Jean-Luc Picard: Abort auto-destruct sequence.

Computer: Riker, William T. Do you concur?

William T. Riker: Yes, absolutely I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly!

Computer: Auto-destruct cancelled.

Jean-Luc Picard: A simple "yes" would have sufficed Number One.

You see he’s met two of your three criteria for sentience; so what if he meets
the third, consciousness, in even the smallest degree? What is he then?
I don’t know, do you?

Guinan: Consider that in the history of many worlds there have always been
disposable creatures. They do the dirty work. They do the work that no one 
else wants to do, because it's too difficult and too hazardous. With an army of
Datas, all disposable, you don't have to think about their welfare, or you 
don't think about how they feel. Whole generations of disposable people.

Jean-Luc Picard: You're talking about slavery.

Guinan: I think that's a little harsh.

Jean-Luc Picard: I don't think that's a little harsh, I think that's the truth.
That's the truth that we have obscured behind a comfortable, easy euphemism.
'Property.' But that's not the issue at all, is it?

Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature,
An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature;
Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses
Contribute to your hunting skills and natural defenses.

I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,
A singular development of cat communications
That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection
For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.

A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents;
You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.
And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion,
It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.

O Spot, the complex levels of behavior you display
Connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.
And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,
I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.
